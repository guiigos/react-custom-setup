# React Custom Setup
Project used as an environment configuration model to run **React**. Focus on this repository and decant the necessary [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) configuration for running in development and production. This project contains settings that are not suitable for initial projects, is typically used in environments that require greater control than behind the curtains, otherwise use the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or other similar tool.
